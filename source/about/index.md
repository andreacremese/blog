## <center> Hi, I am Andrea Cremese. </center>

I am lucky to work with a bunch of very smart, creative and motivated people at [**smartsheet**][1] in Bellevue, WA. I have an  extremely diversified professional experience, spanning different geographical zones and industries.

My main insterests involve using modern technologies, best practices, agile and users insights to build high quality and performant web apps. 

I am also interested in bass (the instrument), running long distances (mostly half marathons). I am wrapping up an MBA with [Durham University Business School](https://www.dur.ac.uk/business/).

Please check out my [linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreacremese) for more information.
