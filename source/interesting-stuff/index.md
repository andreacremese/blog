How often does it happen that you read somethign very interesting off a blog / a youtube video / simlar, and a few months later you cannot retrace your steps to that resource. 

**Never? Really?? Wow!!!**

It sometimes happens to me, so I will try to add here interesting stuff I stumble across 'for future reference'.

### Style Guide
John Papa's presentation at NG Conf 2015, not much for the NG styleguide in itself, but for why youd need a style guide in the first place. Especially starting devs seems to be resisting that idea, hopefully John can make a better case that I ever could.
