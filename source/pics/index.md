There are some "pics" in terms of coding and development in general. Subjects I would like to give a shout out that are not really suitable for a post. 

Also, due to information overload, it often happens that I come across read something interesting off a blog / a youtube video / simlar, and a few months later I cannot really retrace your steps to that resource. So this also doubles up as my *hoarding* space.

# Podcasts
Some interesting podcasts I follow:

* Internet history podcast

# History

## Hackers
This is the go-to book to understand the Mainframe => PC movement in the 70s and 80s, [Hackers by S.Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution).

## Trimph of the nerds
A 1996 PBS report by Robert Cringley about the early days of the PC revolution (in 3 parts).
