There are some "pics" in terms of coding and development in general. Subjects I would like to give a shout out that are not really suitable for a post. 

Also, due to information overload, it often happens that I come across read something interesting off a blog / a youtube video / simlar, and a few months later I cannot really retrace your steps to that resource. So this also doubles up as my *hoarding* space.

# Coding

### You need a style guide
John Papa's presentation at NG Conf 2015, not much for the NG styleguide in itself, but for why you need a style guide in the first place. Especially starting devs seems to be resisting that idea, hopefully John can make a better case that I ever could.

# History

### Hackers
This is the go-to book to understand the Mainframe => PC movement in the 70s and 80s, [Hackers by S.Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution).

### Trimph of the nerds
A 1996 PBS report by Robert Cringley about the early days of the PC revolution (in 3 parts).

# Tools 

### Auto Node Versioning
When using multiple node versiosn in different projects switching may be a pain. [AVN](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) makes it super easy!

# Creativity

### John Cleese on creativity
Being creative is easy, like attacking someone with a banana, [John Cleese explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j-Lz0D5_ck).

# Teams
