John Papa's presentation at NG Conf 2015, not much for the NG styleguide in itself, but for why you need a style guide in the first place. Especially starting devs seems to be resisting that idea, hopefully John can make a better case that I ever could.

# History

### Hackers
This is the go-to book to understand the Mainframe => PC movement in the 70s and 80s, [Hackers by S.Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution).

### Trimph of the nerds
A 1996 PBS report by Robert Cringley about the early days of the PC revolution (in 3 parts).
