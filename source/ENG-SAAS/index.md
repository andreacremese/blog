# The SAAS cheatsheet

If you are working (or are about to start to work) in the US Tech industry sector, the probability you will work in a company that has a SAAS distribution model for its software are extremely high (see for example [this Gartner article](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3616417)). This distribution model has some very specific aspects. 

In this cheat sheet I collected the main metrics and concepts I have came across for SAAS businesses. **As a cheat sheet, this is not supposed to be an encompassing guide, but rather a primer for those working, interviewing, or simply interested in this space.** Each of the metric and concept presented would warrant a separate and deeper analysis.

## SAAS

Software As A Service is a software distribution model where the software is centrally held (hosted), rather than distributed. Licenses to use the software (seats) are sold in subscriptions fashion, for a certain time. This distribution model is contrasted with one of the earliest models of shipping software: a box with a disk inside (aka Licensing Software). Using an analogy, Neetflix (or cable) would be the equivalent of SAAS, while getting the DVD of Home Alone is Licensing. 

SAAS is as well a model of revenue, as instead of a single transaction when the software is purchased (possibly with some consulting services tagged on), it involves a subscription (monthly, annual,...) to which the user can opt in/out. Also, it involves a longer and closer relationship between the customers/users and the software manufacturer.

## Metrics

This section contains some of the key metrics that used to analyze a SAAS business. Please *handle them with extreme care, they are metrics*. Metrics summarize a business' situation, and that's what they are: (very useful) summaries. But they remain summaries, and require deeper analysis. In many cases, looking only at metrics disregarding the story and the circumstances can lead to critical mistakes.

In addition, our brain constantly wants to use shortcuts (see any research from Kahneman and Tversky) or approximate system behaviors to straight lines (which in many cases, is [just plain wrong]([https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world]).

In addition, most SAAS metrics are non-GAAP (more on this below). This means they are not heavily regulated, leaving leeway to the business to interpret them and include / exclude certain items. 

### ARR

In SAAS companies, ARR is usually the `Annual Recurring Revenue` - a measure of the top line of their Profit and Loss. It is calculated by taking the total of subscription contracts that have been closed, and divide that for the length of said contracts (expressed in years). This is a measure of the projected income from signed up subscription per year. Note that subscriptions that can be cancelled monthly may not contribute to the ARR, but a year commitment that is paid monthly does contribute to the ARR. 

For this reason, sometimes businesses report their `MRR`, which is the same measure, but on a monthly basis (also for extra granularity). As this measure are NOT GAAP (see below), there is not a standardized way to report it.

It is sometimes useful to consider ARR for certain classes of customers, e.g. ARR (MRR) for new customers, recurring customers, churned out customers. This is to give an idea of a certain class of customers when compared with the full (projected) P&L top line.

Note that in business analysis ARR can as well be `Accounting rate of return`: a measure to assess the variation in the value of an asset on a year basis. Meaning ARR = (value_@_end - value_@_beginning) / value_@_beginning. For a firm, this can be computed using its total capitalization OR just using the profits (losses) and the capitalization at beginning of the year.

### CAC
Customer acquisition cost - basically how many dollars does it cost to get one extra customer through the marketing funnel and convert them to paying customer. **Needs to be smaller than customerâ€™s Life Time Value, otherwise the SAAS math does not work.**

### LTV (CLTV, LCV and various permutations)
(Customer's) Life Time Value  - how much revenue will the customer generate over its total lifetime (as a customer). **Needs to be greater than Customer acquisition cost, otherwise the SAAS math does not work.**

### Churn
This is one of the most important metrics for a SAAS company. It is a measure of how many existing customers have left in a certain time period. Depending on the business model and size of contracts, healthy SAAS can withstand churns of 10% or more, but please read on.

Not all churns are made equal. Churn is physiological and almost unavoidable for SAAS, BUT the measure to really look at is usually the churn for **customer that are above a certain billing per year** (e.g. 5k/10k). Those are typically the customers that were landed and expanded the amount of service that they purchased, so that churn is much more relevant. If that churn is in double digit, especially if the company has a high price point and lower number of customers, it may be a sign of a weak product / market, or another kind of shift.

### Users VS Customers
Startup tend to report users, but be extra careful as users may be different than customers. In many cases in a SAAS model, a **customer** has multiple seats (i.e. **users**), so there may be a single paying customer per multiple users.

User count is very useful to understand the size of the operations, the potential network effect, and the technical/engineering challenges. But to gauge the financials of a company, ask for the number of (paying) customers.

### Run Rate
Pro rata the income of a single period (say, a quarter) to a year. This is a measure of a business top line that presumes no growth (or decline, for that matter) as it takes current performance and projects that as the bases for the full year. Handle with care: imagine taking the sales on black friday and project to the full year.

### Burn rate
Loss per month. How much is spent per month above the revenue. In a SAAS startup and during launch, cost of good sold (expenses) will inevitably be smaller than the revenue, hence this is likely to be a loss. From this you get the concept of runway. 

### Runway
This is the amount of time a company can remain a going concern assuming the current burn rate / run rate is constant.

### Engineers to Salesman/Marketing ratio
Very very very crudely and depending on loads of factors, the ratio between salesman and engineers is usually somewhere in the 2:1 ballpark for SAAS (see [this analysis](http://tomtunguz.com/saas-spend-allocation-benchmarks/), for example). Meaning, two sales / marketing people for each engineer. Anyhow, the point is that sales and marketing is really important (not all engineers may appreciate this, especially at the beginning of their career). Putting together a killer team of engineers and make an amazing product is likely not to cut it, marketing and sales are essential parts of the execution from the outset.

In addition the figure of **Customer Success** (helping customers achieve their desired goals) is integral to the idea of the land and expand model that is basic for SAAS business.

One example: "Balanced teams with one technical founder and one business founder raise 30% more money" (from the [startup genome project](https://s3.amazonaws.com/startupcompass-public/StartupGenomeReport1_Why_Startups_Succeed_v2.pdf)).

### GAAP measures
Globally Accepted Accounting Principles measure (GAAP) are measures that companies (and regulators, and stock exchange) accept as relevant on their financial statement or S1 (the official document that in the States introduces an IPO). Non-GAAP are measures that do not comply with these requirements. These are not *illegal*, but they are not as tightly defined and therefore not accepted by Stock Exchanges / Regulators.

Non GAAP are actually pretty important for management reporting and as a reference point for investors. One important caveat: non-GAAP are less standardized, meaning comparing the same non-GAAP measure across firms may be comparing apples to oranges (read the fine prints). Most of the metrics above are non-GAAP.

## Some additional concepts

### Network effect
There are many definitions of network effect. The idea is to create a service/platform/service that attract users "simply so they can interact with the existing users" (attributed to Zuck, from this [article](https://www.wired.com/2012/05/network-effects-and-global-domination-the-facebook-strategy/)). So the product becomes more valuable as people have it and use it and are in it.

Examples are the telephone, FB, but as well as MS Office. The fact that others use it, are in it, produce an artifact that can be opened with it makes the product more valuable to an extra user. Office position itself as THE program to create / read spreadsheet in  a business setting, and one could/would not want to be out.

This is one of the holy grail for SAAS businesses, and a great deal of thinking goes into incrementing the network effects when planning and executing on the product. A great Network Effect means lots more leeway in the product development. Meaning, the product can be real bad, and you'll still use it (e.g. Craigslist has a terrible user interface, but its audience makes it useful to me).

### Virality
Not to be confused or conflated with `Network effect`, this simply means that the adoption increases with more adoption. This may be due to fad effects OR just more people are exposed to the product and increase the world of mouth (a very important aspect of increasing usage and adoption). E.g. I may get a `fidget spinner` because everyone else has one, I see it and it seems to helpful to me. But the fact that everyone else gets one does not make the spinner more valuable to me (so it is a viral product, but does not really have network effect).

### Ecosystem
Think about iPhone App store OR Android Play as examples. The idea is to turn the service into a platform for an ecosystem of apps or other services to be build on it, to attract and keep users. For example, the push by MS these days (2017) to open Azure to other technologies (Linux, as one example) is a way to provide an ecosystem.

This is another coveted aspect for SAAS companies, as it keeps users from churning out + keeps developers adding valuable parts. Apple did not get it right for the iPad, as [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/) summarized very well, and it hurt that product.

### Land and expand
This is really a sales concept, which boils down to first land a contract, of any size, with a certain customer. This is usually very tiny, even for very large Fortune 100 companies. Then proceed to grow the account's top line (i.e. the revenue from that contract) by working with the customer, empowering the internal advocates (internal world of mouth), understanding the customer's requests and possibly educating him/her on the productâ€™s additional offers.

In some organizations, different teams deal with the `land` and with the `expand` part. In many cases SAAS companies tend to offer, in addition to the product, consulting on their own product. That is one of the reasons why the sales-to-eng ratio is much greater than one.

### Marketing
It is not Don Draper's killer promotion, it is not the PR around the company / product, it's not the packaging. Marketing is a field in evolution that has changed a lot over the past decades, but it encompasses A LOT of activities and, most importantly, it does not have a constant definition across the board. Marketing touches anything from product, to price, to promotion, to place (yeah, the 4p). To physical evidence, to process, to people (yeah, the extended 7 ps for service companies). Getting it right is key, and most engineers (comprised me at the outset of my career) underestimates and misunderstand this aspect.

For SAAS (and tech firms in general), CMOs (Chief Marketing Officer) are usually more oriented towards *commercialization* rather than *strategy*. This means that they are primarily (not solely) focused on using (a wide variety) of marketing channels to help selling the product, as the innovation is chiefly (not solely) under the engineering wing. In more traditional products, CMOs may actually be heavily involved in the design of products/services/experiences (see [this HBR article]([https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-trouble-with-cmos#the-power-partnership) for gives more insight) for more information).

This is a very wide field, well beyond the scope of a cheat sheet. One bad sign thought? If a company that keeps changing CMOs (Chief Marketing Officers) it may be a sign of confused ideas over what their *raison d'etre* actually is, or their internal structure, or what the CMO is supposed to do.
