This [YouTube Video][website0] by John Cleese reminded and expanded on some of the aspects I have learned so far about SDev, technology and design in general.

So, I will indulge in some notes (mostly for my own benefit). But you should really listen to the presentation, John Cleese is the best by far.

#### Talking about creativity is futile...

Even Freud agreed, why wouldn't you?

#### ...but creativity is NOT a talent - it is a way of operating

(Believing or not) "It is not an ability you have [...] and it is absolutely not related to IQ". The difference was that the most creative had developed a way of operating, a child like ability to play.

And, in some cases, not even explore for a particular reason but more for the sake of exploring in the first place.

#### Open mode and Close Mode of operation

Close mode = There is lots to be done "get on with it!" as at the end fo the [argument clinic][website1]. This mode mostly generates tension and purposefulness.

Open mode = Less purposeful mode, more inclined to humor. More playful. More humorous.

Now, to get the most, the trick is use **open mode** for the solution finding and **close mode** for the delivery. Once the course of action is decided, it is time to ...well..get on with it.

After it is done, it is time to get back at the open mode for review. And so on.

#### Getting out of closed mode
In most cases it is tough to get out of closed mode.

#### Conditions to get into open mode (creativity not guaranteed)

Well, it is not guaranteed you will get something out, but 

* **Space** - Seal yourself off in an undisturbed space.
* **Time** - Have some time cordoned off, pretty precisely identified, to actually do this. It must begin and end as well - at some point (and make sure you can let your brain relax . 1 1/2 hour is a good measure).
* **Time** - You will need time in order to keep playing with the idea and not settle with the first solution that came to mind. Don't take the low-hanging fruit.
* **Confidence** - of no fear of making mistakes (otherwise it is not playfulness). There will be illogical and silly things, but while you are creative there is no such thing as a mistake. 
* **Humor** - It gets us from the close mode to the open mode in the fastest way. Seriousness is not solemnity.


"Easier to do trivial things that are urgent, that to do important things that are not urgent, easier to do things that we can do rather than do things we don't know how to do."

#### How does this connected to code?

First of all, John Cleese goes everywhere, so this does not HAVE to do at all costs with coding. But there is a connection nonetheless, a quite interesting reminder.

The third factor for creativity calls for not settling for the first solution , but rather mull over and find a better way. This is also called - REFACTORING.

Also, this is not indecisiveness, but rather it is making a decision when  it is actually needed - not earlier than that. This also resonates with Sandy Metz Poodr (see earlier posts) on OOD. 

The idea is not to commit to a certain design until is it absolutely time (Chapter 1).

#### Intermediate impossible

The various steps do not require to be right. Random connection might actually lead in interesting places.
