<p>After a bit of hesitation, I decided to participate to a Hakcaton last weekend. As it turned out, for the bewilderment of the most (comprised yours truly), my team won.</p>

<p>From my experience I cannot recommend any highly going to hackatons to other junior developers. There is no substitute for first hand experience, but here are some of my take aways form my first hackaton's experience, in no particular order:</p>
<p><strong>Have balanced team in terms of skills.</strong> Knowing the team mates ahead is not a must, but knowing you have the basic skills covered when the full court pressing starts it is. If you are jr and starting out, don't get intimidated, still go and ask to join a group - you are likely to have something to offer (or you will learn what you need to be able to offer next time).</p>
<p><strong>Don't get too attached to an idea</strong>, if it sucks it is best to weed it out - even if you are 6 hours into the event. (It happened to us, as we still won). Key to this, we did not started coding on the idea straight away - think it would have been much harder to discard it.
</p>
<p><strong>Read the brief well</strong> and, in case staff of the organization is present, involve them at the end of each "scrums" to review the idea. You will have a feeling for what kind of reaction you will get in the presentation, and you might get some cool ideas form them as well. You will also make sure you don't end up developing something the organizer already has.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your product is gonna be <strong>PRESENTED in a LIMITED TIME FRAME</strong>. This means: after a certain time it is the presentation that drives the code and the functionality that gets implemented. Not the other way around.
</p>
<p>Concentrate on the <strong>two/three killer features</strong> that will 1) make sense for your product and 2) implemented in the right way will WOW the jury (in our case: a well presented search engine, integration with Hangouts).
</p>
<p><strong>Don't skip the standard agile steps</strong>: do the wireframes and think about your model structure and associations upfront. You will pay a high price later if you don't.
</p>
<p><strong>Do scrums for the PRESENTATION as well.</strong> Also, include everyone in the presentation's preparation - they will know what to develop and what not to develop.
</p>
<p>A simple but effective <strong>front end</strong> goes a long way. 
</p>

<p>Some other random points: <br><strong>Have fun, take breaks, make silly jokes, look after your gear (sadly), pile up sleep before, go easy on the coffee, clean out the work area after each review. Or even change the work area.
</strong></p><br>

<p>A few bonus points for Rails developers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review very well git.</li>
<li>Scaffolds are the devil for Rails, but they work in a hackaton.</li>
<li>Your code will be messy and not elegant BUT it needs to work. </li>
