<p>So I passed the Saturday afternoon doing Ruby exercises and trying to figure out a small trial programme to simulate a snotty teenager </p>
<p>I ended up enjoying it quite a bit, for the challenge, for the quick rewards that programming is able to bring and also as it reminds me of Fall of some 10 years (!!!!) when I was spending my saturday afternoon trying to figure out C for a module at university</p>
<p>Time changes, but puts and gets (at the time were printf and scanf) are always a great way to warm up before a session of coding, being that irb or C</p>
<p> Ah, I also woke up quite happy as my best friend forever (for real) just had a baby, and sent me this text: </p>
<p1>"I hear from the cot my little baby crying. I gently lean out of bed a bit and I put my hand in the small cot, to give the little buy a light lovely pet. He calms down straight away. Incredible satisfaction and self esteem shooting through the roof.</p1>
<p1>Such a pity that I actually pet the pelucheâ€¦</p1>
