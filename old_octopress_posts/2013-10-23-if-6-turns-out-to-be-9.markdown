<h2>â€¦or even less</h2>
<p> As Jimi would say, I don't mind.<p>
<p> Impressive how many pre made solutions are made to make one's life easy in Ruby. Ruby does love you, with a single line that replaces some 6 odd command lines. And, as an addition, no declaration of varibles and the variables have rolled inside some functions that can do stuff for you. So long passing arguments to functions and hoping for the best on the other end. Ha ha ha. </p>

<p>Ruby loves you, true, but GitHub truly hates you!</p>
