For a while I have wanted to write about a cool activity I got to do at the back end of last year. It was a little bit of time ago, and it has nothing to do with coding per se, but being-too-busy is not an excuse, and it was real fun too. 

And this is my blog anyway, so here goes.

##BASE students in visit

Last December a group of four sophomore students at Bronx Academy for Software Engineering (BASE) high school visited the office of the software consulting firm I work for in the City (Fino Consulting).

One of the students is my mentee in the [iMentor](www.imentor.com) project, an awesome organization that "[...] builds mentoring relationships that empower students from low-income communities to graduate high school, succeed in college, and achieve their ambitions". 

If you are a professional in tech and you would like to get involved in some light touch but extremely meaningful work I could not recommend iMentor more.

##Visit of the office
It was quite interesting to observe the students visiting a software engineering office for the first time.

Firstly, for some reason the idea of cubicles still has not left he common imaginary for software engineers and, being the office structured as an open space, the students were pretty surprised not to see cubicles. The design and degree of openness of the space was rated very high up for the visit.

Secondly, noise level. The visit took place during a random afternoon, with some staff seconded to a client and some working very quietly (i.e. many people were in dark hours coding / working). Nonetheless the unanimous comment from the students was that the office was pretty loud, which came as an absolute surprise to me. Am pretty sure that the benchmark must be their classroom.

Lastly, they were some comments on the level of interaction that they saw between the team members - I guess the mind model is still the old school model of a single operative "doing his thing" in isolation. 


##Presentation
After the office grand tour, I presented and explained to the students the basic tenements of Agile and the application of its processes for software development. Starting from the basic ideas (working code, constant contact with the stakeholders,continuous deployment,...) we ended up delving into basic ideas such as scrum cycle and story mapping with actual examples drawn from our client work. 

It was quite interesting to see the type of question that were asked by the students, as none of them had prior involvement in waterfall. Hence, the questions were more open and curious, aimed at uncovering the nitty gritty of the agile process rather than comparison with a waterfall system. I suppose that the sense of Agile was readily understood very early in the presentation. Ah, young brains!!!! =)

My colleague Jimmy Marsanico lead the following session of the presentation, introducing the basics of data science to the students, with concrete working examples from a project where they could touch and see the actual code running and whatnot.

In addition Our CTO Christian Jungers (also a former mentor for iMentor) kindly supported the presentation and added his views during the Q&A.

##Final thoughts
It was very fulfilling to see the students getting excited about engineering, being able to see and relate what they are starting studying with what could be a career later on. I also have an extremely good relationship with my mentee, who I am really proud of. 

In addition, as at the time I was involved in a product for the Ed Tech world, this activity helped putting my effort and in general the app into context.
